## Design Choices

### Fonts

When I started this project I had intended on using [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
 for the headings and navbar links. I also had planned on using [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?query=nunito) 
for the paragraphs. However, I was unhappy with how these fonts looked so I decided to use [Domine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Domine?query=domine) for the headings and the navbar links.
I then used [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?query=nunito) for the paragraphs.

### Colours

- For the header and footer I used a green #1ac741 I chose this colour as it reminded me of fresh ingrdients which I felt was fitting for a recipe website.
- To contrast this I chose white #fff for the background colour of the body.
- I also used white #fff for the font in the header and footer as I felt it worked well with the shade of green that I used.
- For the headingd and paragraphs outside in the main body I used a dark grey #5C5553.
