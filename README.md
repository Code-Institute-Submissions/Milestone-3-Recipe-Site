## Design Choices

### Fonts

When I started this project I had intended on using [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
 for the headings and navbar links. I also had planned on using [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?query=nunito) 
for the paragraphs. However, I was unhappy with how these fonts looked so I decided to use [Domine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Domine?query=domine) for the headings and the navbar links.
I then used [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?query=nunito) for the paragraphs.

### Colours

- Originally for the header and footer I was planning on using a green as it reminded me of fresh ingrdients which I felt was fitting for a recipe website.
However, I was not happy with how it looked so I instead decided to go with a maroon to match the marroon coloured salad leaves in the main image on the home page.
- To contrast this I chose white #fff for the background colour of the body.
- I also used white #fff for the font in the header and footer as I felt it worked well with the shade of maroon that I used.
- For the headings and paragraphs in the main body I used a dark grey #5C5553.
